# Current_Research_Areas_in_ST_MCI
This is the repository for the course Current Research Areas in ST at MCI. The goal here is to have a closer look on topic that are currently relevant in Sports Technologies

# Requirements & Virtual Environment
The repository has a requirements.txt file for every jupyter notebook and a preinstalled virtual environment with .venv. Be aware, that .venv on has pip and setuptool installed but no other packages. If you want to run a specific notebook, let pip install the requirements.txt file within the notebook's folder after you have activated the virtual environment. This way you can make sure, that you do not touch you default environment.
